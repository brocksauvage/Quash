[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mchdir[22m() changes the current working directory of the calling process to the direc‚Äê
       tory specified in [4mpath[24m.

       [1mfchdir[22m() is identical to [1mchdir[22m(); the only difference is  that  the  directory  is
       given as an open file descriptor.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and [4merrno[24m is set appro‚Äê
       priately.

[1mERRORS[0m
       Depending on the filesystem, other errors  can  be  returned.   The  more  general
       errors for [1mchdir[22m() are listed below:

       [1mEACCES [22mSearch  permission  is denied for one of the components of [4mpath[24m.  (See also
              [1mpath_resolution[22m(7).)

       [1mEFAULT [4m[22mpath[24m points outside your accessible address space.

       [1mEIO    [22mAn I/O error occurred.

       [1mELOOP  [22mToo many symbolic links were encountered in resolving [4mpath[24m.

       [1mENAMETOOLONG[0m
              [4mpath[24m is too long.

       [1mENOENT [22mThe directory specified in [4mpath[24m does not exist.

       [1mENOMEM [22mInsufficient kernel memory was available.

       [1mENOTDIR[0m
              A component of [4mpath[24m is not a directory.

       The general errors for [1mfchdir[22m() are listed below:

       [1mEACCES [22mSearch permission was denied on the directory open on [4mfd[24m.

       [1mEBADF  [4m[22mfd[24m is not a valid file descriptor.

[1mCONFORMING TO[0m
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD.

[1mNOTES[0m
       The current working directory is the  starting  point  for  interpreting  relative
       pathnames (those not starting with '/').

       A  child  process created via [1mfork[22m(2) inherits its parent's current working direc‚Äê
       tory.  The current working directory is left unchanged by [1mexecve[22m(2).
